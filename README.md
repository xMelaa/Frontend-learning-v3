# Frontend-learning-v3


These are the excercises from the Envato Tuts+ course (HTML & CSS for Beginners https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG2jotQo9NI)
I tried to do all the tasks and homeworks by myself first (especially excercise 4) or outstrip of the video.
I have only problem with styling checkboxes but i think i will learn it in future.
